        I finally finished the challenge on time, I hope ðŸ˜„. I admit Angular never was my first choice as a web framework; I liked React more, even if it is considered a library. ðŸ˜…

        Well, to say it all, these challenging days went great ðŸ˜„ and were hard enough to learn a new framework in just five days.
        But one of my biggest problems is my stubbornness, so I rolled up my sleeves and started to read articles and documentation on angular ðŸ˜‚.
