# ToDo App
You can see it live on Netlify [Go TO SEE IT DEPLOYED!](https://nd-todoapp-angular.netlify.app/)

## Objective:
Your goal is to create a simple Angular application for managing a to-do list.

## Features
- [x] Display a list of tasks.
- [x] Allow the user to add a new task.
- [x] Allow the user to mark a task as completed.
- [x] Allow the user to remove a task.
- [x] Add a filter feature to show only completed tasks or only tasks that need to be done.
- [x] Implement a counter that shows the total number of tasks and the number of completed tasks.

## Guidelines
- [x] Use Angular CLI to create a new project.
- [x] Use separate components for the task list and the form to add new tasks.
- [x] Use a service to handle task logic, such as retrieving, adding, removing, and counting tasks.
- [x] Use two-way data binding to keep data synchronized between the task list component and the add task form.
- [x] Use `ngIf` or `ngFor` to show or hide elements based on conditions.

## Bonus (optional):
- [x] Add the functionality to edit an existing task.
- [x] Implement an attractive user interface using CSS or a styling framework like Bootstrap or Angular Material.
- [x] Use routing to create a detail page for each task, with the ability to edit task details.

## Purpose
The purpose of this test is to understand how you think, how you approach and solve problems, and, of course, your creative side. Impress us!
